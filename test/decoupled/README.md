# Decoupled Rendering (Experimental)

This folder contains an experimental "dual-canvas" implementation that renders Earth and Moon in two separate WebGL canvases and composes them in the DOM. This achieves hard isolation of lighting rigs without touching the main `src/scene` pipeline.

Status: scaffolding only. Hook up after visual validation.
